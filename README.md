# URX
An extensible library for handling Resource Identifies in a web-generation context.

# Overview
Development Status: Mid Alpha

Functionality: Minimal

# Details
Specially engineered from the ground up to convert all forms of Resource Identifier into an object that can be made used of and optionally rendered in a uniform way. This is not designed to be especially useful outside of other projects which might make use of this feature as a core module.

See Uniform Entity Resource (EUR) readme file for details: https://github.com/lordmatt/URX/blob/master/UER/readme.txt

This project is a rewrite of UEntity which does the same thing and works but is, IMHO, not well written. I can make it available if anyone is really interested.

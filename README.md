# URX
An extensible library for handling Resource Identifies in a web-generation context.

Development Status: Early Alpha

Functionality: Minimal

Specially engineered from the ground up to convert all forms of Resource Identifier into an object that can be made used of and optionally rendered in a uniform way. This is not designed to be especially useful outside of other projects which might make use of this feature as a core module.

See Uniform Entity Resource (EUR) readme file for details: https://github.com/lordmatt/URX/blob/master/UER/readme.txt
